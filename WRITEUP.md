### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

App Service solution for the CMS app:
Cost: App Service is cheapest and fastest way to host a web application at azure. Although, I dont have the exact figures with App service you dont need a lot of people just to setup a project. With a minimal work, a server can be setup and needing a high expertise in linux, network and other configurations.

Scalability: App service has a max 4gb ram. This is a sufficient to host a new application. For the storage, we can utilize Blog storages and databases for the data.

Availability: App service has a high availability commitment.

Workflow: The deployment process with app service is easy. The system has a automated to steps to automate the setup of server platform. This will install the necessary configurations, applications and packages. This will also configure the network settings. for the code, code can be deployed at github. and Once you do changes it will automatically reflect on the server.

Why I chose App Service?

My number one consideration is the cost. for any new application, I always recommend to tend to use cheaper solution like app service. It is easy to setup and go live with cheap cost on the platform and no need to have a lot of man power just to publish an application. 

I dont worry for scalling because when there is need to upgrade we can easily transpose the project to Azure Virtual machine.
